# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table within SQLite Studio to import the data into. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

After inserting the Spotify dataset csv file into the table, I performed the below analysis using SQL:


#1. Who were the top 10 Artists in 2021 (by popularity)?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#2. How popular were the songs that had the most danceability, and what were the track names?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

#3. Which artists have more than 2 records on the Top 50 list, and how popular are their tracks?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name), avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(artist_name)>=2
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc;

#4. How danceable are the 5 saddest songs on the list?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, speechiness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY speechiness asc
LIMIT 1;
