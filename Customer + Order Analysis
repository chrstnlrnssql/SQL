SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
AND product='iPhone';

#3. What were the customer account numbers for the orders placed in February?

SELECT DISTINCT product, min(price)

SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA, 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spend for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_ID=feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
AND FEB.quantity>2;

#8. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_ID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid <> 'order ID';

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)

AND orderid <> 'order ID';

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
